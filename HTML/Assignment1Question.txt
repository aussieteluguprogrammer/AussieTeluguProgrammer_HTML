Question:
You have been approached by a local bookstore named "Literary Luminary" to help create a simple HTML webpage for them. Here's what they're looking for:
Requirements:
Title: The title of the page should be "Literary Luminary: Your Local Bookstore".
Header: The webpage should have a main header with the name of the bookstore and a brief slogan of your choice.
Navigation: Create a simple navigation bar with links to "Home", "About", "Books", and "Contact". (Note: The links don't need to lead anywhere for this exercise.)
Main Content:
Welcome Section: A brief welcome message introducing the bookstore to new visitors.
Featured Books: Display a list of 3-4 books that are currently popular. For each book, provide:
A placeholder image for the book cover.
The title of the book.
A brief description or synopsis.
Footer:
Add a footer with copyright information for the bookstore.
Include links for "Privacy Policy" and "Terms & Conditions" (again, these don't need to lead anywhere).
Bonus:
Contact Form: Under the "Contact" section in your navigation, add a simple contact form where users can input their name, email, and a message.
Styles: While the primary focus is HTML, feel free to add some inline or internal CSS to enhance the appearance of the page.
